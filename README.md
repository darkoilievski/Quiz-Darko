I received this quiz app as a suggestion from a course i followed, and since i have passion for logical/trivia games i decided to make it.At first i built it with only one category and later while reviewing the API-s documentation i decided to implement all of the categories, difficulties and the type of question.This was one of the most challenging projects i did so far. The app is fully responsive. My wife is playing it daily :)

The only thing i regret is not committing this often, so i can review it later and see what i was doing worng...

The API i used is - [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/)
